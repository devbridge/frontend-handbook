- Default `box-sizing` value is `content-box` for all HTML elements. Even though the best practice is to set it to `border-box`.
- `box-sizing` property should be set in the very start in CSS for every element and pseudo-elements as it affects _all_ the elements and their layout. 
- Avoid setting / updating `box-sizing` to `content-box` unless it solves a difficult layout task.

`box-sizing` property is essentialy all about percentage of an element, relevant to parent.
