# Pseudo-element

::: tip ðŸ¤”Caveats and pitfalls
- A selector can be combined, nested and grouped, thus becoming a complex string. 
- Nesting and adding combinators `>`, `~`, `+` increase specifity and selectors become difficult to maintain. It should be **avoided**.
- ID selectors styling should avoided as it's not reusable and very aggresive specifity-wise.
- Every selector selects _all_ corresponding items.
