# Frontend Handbook by Devbridge  #

This handbook features a hand-picked and organized selection of tips and solutions to some recurring problems in frontend development. 

The most common **caveats and pitfalls** are backed with concise theory about certain language / tool.

## Motivation 

Frontend tooling can get tricky and unpredictable.

The main goal of this handbook is to provide high quality shortcuts and solutions to common problems for:
- Junior frontend engineers who are overwhelmed with the amount of vague information.
- Backend engineers who are wandering about the best practices and solutions in the frontend land.
- ...anyone else who strives for some in-depth frontend knowledge.

## Contribution

Frontend Handbook is Devbridge frontend community-driven project. Be mindful when contributing:
- Start with  quick common **caveats and pitfalls** - common gotchas, mistakes of misconseptions.
- Concicely describe key theoretical aspects, add references to standards and specifications.
- Provide working code examples/demos in [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/), if applicable.
- Don't get too comprehensive - this is __**not**__ a list of all HTML/CSS/JS APIs (like MDN or w3schools).
- Don't add experimental, poorly tested or suported features.
- All contributions should be validated by peers - especially when suggesting best practices.
